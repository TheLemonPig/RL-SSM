# RL-SSM

Read the notebook you see above for the most up to date version.

Order of Notebooks to read to learn RL-SSM for PyMC

1. Introduction to PyTensor
2. PyTensor for RL
3. RL_Practice (section 5 only)
4. RLWM_SSM_differentiable

You can find RWLM minus SSM code in rlwm_testing.ipynb (however this notebook was used more for testing and is less well commented so only look into this notebook after you have looked through RLWM_SSM_differentiable.ipynb)
